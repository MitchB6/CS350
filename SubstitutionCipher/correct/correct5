Climate change is having a devastating impact on polar bears, whose primary habitat is the rapidly melting Arctic ice. As the ice disappears, polar bears are struggling to find food and are increasingly encroaching on human settlements. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these magnificent creatures, including setting up protected areas and tracking the movements of polar bear populations. It's a stark reminder of the urgent need to address climate change.
