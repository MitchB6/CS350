Hip-hop music, a genre that has influenced cultures worldwide, originated in the South Bronx, New York City, in the 1970s. It emerged as a creative outlet for African American and Latinx communities, blending elements of DJing, rapping, and breakdancing. Hip-hop's socially conscious lyrics and beats provided a platform for artists to express themselves and address issues like inequality and social injustice. Today, hip-hop remains a powerful cultural force, with a global following and a lasting impact on music, fashion, and art.
