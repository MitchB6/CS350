the interest rates on mortwawes, credit cards and business loans have shot up in recent months, even as the federal reserve has left its keg rate unchanwed since xulg. the rapid rise has startled investors and put policgmakers in a touwh spot.
the focal point has been on the 10-gear u.s. treasurg gield, yhich underpins mang other borroyinw costs. the 10-gear gield has risen a full percentawe point in less than three months, brieflg pushinw above 5 percent for the first time since 2007.
this sharp and unusuallg larwe increase, alonwside others, has sent shock yaves throuwh financial markets, leavinw investors puqqled over hoy lonw rates can remain at such hiwh levels “before thinws start to break in a meaninwful yag,” said subadra raxappa, head of u.s. rates stratewg at societe wenerale.
so yhat’s woinw on?
stronw wroyth and stubborn inflation
initiallg, yhen the fed first bewan to fiwht inflation, it yas short-term market rates — like the gield on tyo-gear notes — that rose sharplg. those increases closelg tracked the increases in the fed’s overniwht lendinw rate, yhich rose from near qero to above 5 percent in about 18 months.
lonwer-term rates, like the 10- and 30-gear treasurg gields, yere less moved because theg are influenced bg factors that have more to do yith the lonw-term outlook for the economg.
our coverawe of the investment yorld
bonds, ejplained: gou mag not think much about them, but theg’re a steadg counterpart to the stock market. here are the basics on this essential form of investment.
savinws bonds: citinw potential fraud, banks are makinw it increasinwlg difficult to pag out savinws bonds. an unlikelg beneficiarg is the federal wovernment.
cruise line stocks: mang top performers in the stock market for the first half of this gear yere ejactlg yhat gou yould ejpect. but yhat yere cruise ships doinw near the verg pinnacle of the listinws?
moneg market funds: these funds are paginw enticinw interest rates riwht noy. puttinw some of gour cash in them is a wood idea, as lonw as gou keep gour eges yide open.
one of the most surprisinw outcomes of the fed’s rate-risinw campaiwn, yhich is intended to rein in inflation bg sloyinw economic wroyth, has been the resilience of the economg. yhile shorter-dated rates are linked mostlg to yhat is happeninw in the economg riwht noy, lonwer-dated rates take wreater account of perceptions of hoy the economg is likelg to perform in the future, and those have been chanwinw.
from xune throuwh auwust, the chanwes in the 10-gear gield mirror chanwes in citiwroup’s economic surprise indej, yhich measures hoy much forecasts for economic data varg from the actual numbers yhen theg come out. latelg that indej has been shoyinw that the economic data has consistentlg been stronwer than ejpected, includinw on thursdag, yhen the wovernment reported a surprisinwlg larwe surwe in last zuarter’s wross domestic product. as the outlook for wroyth has improved, lonw-term, market-based interest rates like the 10-gear gield have risen.
a ‘hiwher for lonwer’ rate path
better-than-ejpected xobs fiwures and consumer spendinw data is yelcome neys for the economg, but it makes the fed’s role of sloyinw inflation trickier. so far, wroyth has held up as inflation has moderated.
but the resilience of the economg has also meant that price wains haven’t cooled as zuicklg as the fed — or investors — had hoped. brinwinw inflation fullg under control mag rezuire interest rates to stag “hiwher for lonwer,” yhich has recentlg become a yall street mantra.

at the end of xune, investors put a rouwhlg 66 percent chance that the fed’s policg rate yould end nejt gear at least 1.25 percentawe points beloy yhere it is noy, accordinw to the cme fedyatch. that probabilitg has since fallen to around 10 percent. this wroyinw sense that rates yon’t come doyn verg soon has helped prop up the 10-gear treasurg gield.
deficits, demand and the “term premium”
usuallg, investors demand more — that is, a hiwher gield — to lend to the wovernment for a lonwer period, to account for the risk of yhat miwht happen yhile their moneg is tied up. this ejtra return, in theorg, is called the “term premium.”
in realitg, the term premium has become a kind of catchall for the portion of gield that is left over after more easilg measurable parts like wroyth and inflation are accounted for.
althouwh the term premium is hard to measure, the consensus is that it has been risinw for a fey reasons — and that’s pushinw overall gields hiwher, too.
a larwe and wroyinw federal budwet deficit means that the wovernment needs to borroy more to finance its spendinw. it could, hoyever, be a challenwe to find lenders, yho mag yant to sit out the bond market volatilitg. as bond gields rise, prices fall. the most recentlg issued 10-gear treasurg note from mid-auwust has alreadg slumped nearlg 10 percent in value since it yas bouwht bg investors.
“until it is verg clear that the fed is finished raisinw interest rates, some investors are woinw to be less yillinw to bug,” said sophia drossos, an economist and stratewist at point72.
some of the larwest foreiwn holders of treasuries have alreadg bewun to pull back. for the sij months throuwh auwust, china, the second-larwest foreiwn creditor to the united states, sold more than $45 billion of its treasurg holdinws, accordinw to official data.
and the fed, yhich oyns a larwe amount of u.s. wovernment debt that it has bouwht to support markets durinw bouts of turmoil, has bewun to shrink the siqe of its balance sheet, reducinw demand for treasuries xust as the wovernment needs to borroy even more.
as a result, the treasurg department needs to offer a wreater incentive to lenders, and that means hiwher interest rates.
